# Detect objects using opencv
The program detects the brightly colored landing platform and makes a bounding box around it using python opencv(also points the geometric centre of the box). I have used a sample video(from youtube) for demonstration. The code is capable of detecting other landing platforms as well provided we change the HSV limits for masking. The code also prints the pixel location of the geometric centric of the bounding box dynamically.     
Detecting objects and creating bounding box around them can be very useful in many fields like precision landing in drones etc.
